[![A game report generated by stats-hand](/images/stats-hand.png)](https://blasco.shinyapps.io/stats-hand/)

This webapp developped in R Shiny turns a PDF match report into a dashboard that describes key stats and moments of the game.

It works on match sheets available on the [French Handball Federation website](https://www.ffhandball.fr/).

It is available at <https://blasco.shinyapps.io/stats-hand/>. Download [a match sheet](/files/SAEIUDC.pdf) and try it for yourself!
