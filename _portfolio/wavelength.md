[![An instance of the Wavelength game](/images/wavelength.png)](https://julienblasco.shinyapps.io/wavelength/)

This webapp replicates the [wavelength board game](https://www.wavelength.zone/).

Teams have to take turn rotating a dial to where they think a hidden bullseye is located on a spectrum.

It is available at <https://julienblasco.shinyapps.io/wavelength/>. Click and start a game (in French)!
