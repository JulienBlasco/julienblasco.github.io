excerpt: 'This paper examines the regressive nature of consumption taxes and their impact on income inequality across different countries. Using household budget data and microsimulation, we find that consumption taxes disproportionately burden low-income households in all countries. Moreover, the increase in income inequality resulting from consumption taxes offsets approximately one-third of the redistributive effect of tax-benefit systems. The variation in the inequality effect of consumption taxes primarily stems from differences in implicit tax rates among countries, rather than variations in household consumption patterns. Consumption taxes should therefore be taken into account when comparing income inequality and tax-benefit systems across countries, as the most-redistributive systems generally come with high consumption taxes.'

This paper examines the regressive nature of consumption taxes and their impact on income inequality across different countries. Using household budget data and microsimulation, we find that consumption taxes disproportionately burden low-income households in all countries. Moreover, the increase in income inequality resulting from consumption taxes offsets approximately one-third of the redistributive effect of tax-benefit systems. The variation in the inequality effect of consumption taxes primarily stems from differences in implicit tax rates among countries, rather than variations in household consumption patterns. Consumption taxes should therefore be taken into account when comparing income inequality and tax-benefit systems across countries, as the most-redistributive systems generally come with high consumption taxes.
